# Robot Pick and Place Mechanism
I designed and modeled a Pick and Place robotic mechanism using SolidWorks, integrating mechanical motion and automation principles. The system uses a rack and pinion mechanism driven by a linear actuator to achieve controlled linear movement, enabling a robotic arm to pick and place objects effectively. All components were created from scratch within the assembly mode for better alignment and referencing.

Key Highlights

1) Modeled a spur gear and rack system with proper module and teeth parameters

2) Designed a custom gripper arm with safety features like edge fillets to avoid sharp profiles

3) Implemented mechanical mates (coincident, concentric, rack & pinion) to simulate real motion

4) Added an actuator setup to drive the mechanism using distance-based motion

5) Applied motion studies and animation controls using motors and time intervals

6) Focused on modularity, clean design, and manufacturable geometry

This project helped me explore advanced SolidWorks features like Toolbox gears, in-context part creation, and motion simulation with real-time actuator movement and jaw gripping.
